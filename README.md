# TetrisJS

Major Issue: There is currently a severe game breaking bug that makes this game unplayable. The bug is not reproducible as far as I can tell, so it's unfortunately difficult for me to figure out the cause until I can find what causes it. It happens often, but only after a few minutes of gameplay.

Perhaps I will revisit this when I get the time, it's a shame because most of the gameplay is implemented and looking decent. Unfortunately this bug is too major for me to consider this complete.

# First time setup 

`npm install`

# Running the app

`npm run start`
